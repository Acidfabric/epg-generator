# EPG generator

Simple EPG generator wich runs on AWS lambda. Infrastructure are deployable trough [serverless framework](https://serverless.com).

Serverless Framework enables you to seemlessly deploy applications to AWS. However, this does require AWS Credentials to do so. There are a few ways to supply your credentials, preferred approach it to use the AWS CLI to configure details.

In order to use Serverless on AWS you will need an AWS Account. If you donâ€™t already have one, you can sign up for a free trial that includes 1 million free AWS Lambda requests per month.

2. Install global serverless dependencies:

```sh

3. Rename `env.configs.yml.example` file to `env.configs.yml` and fill it wit values:

```yaml
# Targeted deployment stage (you can leave at it is)
stage: prod
# Targeted aws region (you can leave at it is)
region: eu-central-1
# Bucket name (Bucket will be created in deployment step. Pick a unique name. Only lowercase allowed)
bucket: my-custom-epg-bucket-name
# Generated EPG file name

```

4. Build application.
